# hello-world
Just another repository to test my capability of following basic instructions on my journey to code.
Not only that, but also another hello and a bit more about myself, but not too much because of the internet spreading things quicker than melting butter on toast. So, I'm basically learning code to A) prove some people wrong in my life, and B) to affirm my own suspicion that I might like coding as an alternative career path. I'm a pet person, I'm also NOT a single pringle, and have a dream to get my doctorate in biochemistry. I think that this is all I will have here for now.
